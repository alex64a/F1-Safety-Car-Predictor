## Project Summary

My friend and I are passionate Formula 1 fans, and we’ve always been fascinated by the strategic impact of Safety Car deployments during a race. To explore this further, we built an F1 Safety Car Predictor, a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a Safety Car being deployed in an F1 race.

Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, we developed a Random Forest model trained on a custom-built dataset (CSV file) filled with historical race data, track conditions, weather, and past Safety Car occurrences. Our goal was to analyze patterns and create a tool that could provide real-time predictions for teams, analysts, or F1 enthusiasts.

## Key Features
- Custom Dataset – We manually compiled an extensive dataset with race-related factors.
- Machine Learning Model – Used a Random Forest classifier to predict Safety Car deployments.
- Feature Engineering – Incorporated weather conditions, track incidents, and historical safety car trends.
- Performance Evaluation – Optimized the model using accuracy scores, feature importance analysis, and validation techniques.
- Jupyter Notebook Workflow – Fully documented and structured in an interactive notebook for easy experimentation.
